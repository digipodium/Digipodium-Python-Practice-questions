4. Write a program to check if a given key exists in a dictionary.
   ```

    ```
   `Hint: Use the `in` operator to check for key existence.`

5. Write a program to remove a specific key from a dictionary.
   ```
   Sample data: {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
   ```
   `Hint: Use the `pop()` method to remove the key.`

6. Write a program to find the common keys in two dictionaries.
   ```
   Sample data:
   dict1 = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}

   ````
   `Hint: Use the `keys()` method to get the keys and compare them.`

7. Write a program to get the length of a dictionary.

   Sample data: {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
    ```
   `Hint: Use the `len()` function to calculate the length.`

8. Write a program to sort a dictionary by its keys in ascending order.
    ```

   ```
   `Hint: Use the `min()` function with a custom key argument to find the minimum value.`

10. Write a program to get the values of a dictionary as a list.
    ```
    Sample data: {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
    ```
    `Hint: Use the `values()` method to get the values and convert them into a list.`

11. Write a program to check if a given value exists in a dictionary.
    ```
    Sample data: {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
    ```
    `Hint: Use the `values()` method and the `in` operator to check for value existence.`

12. Write a program to create a dictionary with keys as numbers from 1 to 10 and their squares as values.
    ```
    Sample data: 
    keys: [1, 2, 3, ..., 10]
    values: [1, 4, 9, ..., 100]
    ```
    
    `Hint: Use a for loop and the dictionary's indexing to create the dictionary.`

13. Write a program to find the difference between two dictionaries.
    ```
    Sample data:
    dict1 = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
    dict2 = {"b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 4}
    ```
    `Hint: Use the keys() and items() methods to find the difference between the dictionaries.`

14. Write a program to remove all the items from a dictionary.
    ```
    Sample data: {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
    ```
    `Hint: Use the clear() method to remove all items from the dictionary.`

15. Write a program to convert a dictionary into a list of tuples.
    ```
    Sample data: {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
    ```
    `Hint: Use the items() method to convert the dictionary into a list of tuples.`

16. Write a program to check if all the values in a dictionary are unique.
    ```Sample data: {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}```

    `Hint: Convert the dictionary values into a set and compare the lengths.`

17. Write a program to extract all the values from nested dictionaries into a single list.
    ```
    Sample data: {"a": 1, "b": {"c": 2, "d": 3}, "e": 4}
    ```
    `Hint: Use recursion to iterate through the nested dictionaries and extract the values.`

18. Write a program to find the key-value pairs that have the highest values in a dictionary.
    ```
    Sample data: {"a": 10, "b": 5, "c": 10}
    ```
    `Hint: Use the items() method and the max() function with a custom key argument to find the highest values.`

19. Write a program to create a dictionary from two lists, one containing keys and the other containing values.
    ```
    Sample data:
    keys = ["a", "b", "c"]
    values = [1, 2, 3]
    ```

    `Hint: Use the zip() function to combine the two lists into key-value pairs.`

20. Write a program to iterate over a dictionary and print the keys and values.
    ```
    Sample data: {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
    ```
