#### tasks for generating different types of plots using the Iris dataset, pandas, and Matplotlib:

1. Scatter Plot with Different Colors:
   Task: Create a scatter plot of sepal length against sepal width for the Iris dataset. Use different colors for each species to distinguish them. Customize the plot with appropriate labels and a legend.

2. Histogram for Feature Distribution:
   Task: Generate a histogram to visualize the distribution of petal length for all samples in the Iris dataset. Customize the plot with appropriate labels and adjust the number of bins to display the data effectively.

3. Box Plot Comparison:
   Task: Create a box plot to compare the sepal width distributions for each species in the Iris dataset. Customize the plot by assigning different colors to each species, adding appropriate labels, and adjusting the style of the box plot (e.g., adding outliers, changing whisker styles).

4. Line Plot with Multiple Lines:
   Task: Generate a line plot to compare the variations of sepal length and petal length across the samples in the Iris dataset. Each line represents a different species. Customize the plot by adding appropriate labels and a legend.

5. Bar Chart for Categorical Data:
   Task: Create a bar chart to display the frequency of each species in the Iris dataset. Customize the plot with appropriate labels, a title, and different colors for each species.
